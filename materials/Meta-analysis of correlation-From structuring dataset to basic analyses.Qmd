## Dataset for a meta-analysis of a correlation coefficient

```{r, include=F, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
set.seed(0)
library(psych)
nStudies = 10
nSamples = 15
weights = runif(nStudies,0.9,1.1)
idStudy = colSums(rmultinom(nSamples,1,prob=weights)*(1:nStudies))
idStudy = idStudy[order(idStudy)]
idStudy = as.numeric(as.factor(idStudy))
rIntStudy = rep(NA,length(idStudy))
idSample = rep(NA,length(idStudy))
rIntSample = rnorm(length(idStudy),0,.1)
yearPub = rep(NA,length(idStudy))
lvl = levels(as.factor(idStudy))
for(i in 1:length(lvl)){
  rIntStudy[idStudy==lvl[i]] = rnorm(1,0,.2)
  yearPub[idStudy==lvl[i]] = round(runif(1,2006,2024))
  idSample[idStudy==lvl[i]] = paste0(lvl[i],"_",1:sum(idStudy==lvl[i]))
}
true_eff = 0.20 + rIntSample + rIntStudy
n = round(runif(length(idSample),40,500))
eff = true_eff + rnorm(length(n),0,sqrt(1/(n-3)))
corr = round(fisherz2r(eff),3)
df = data.frame(StudyID=idStudy,yearPub=yearPub,SampleID=idSample,EffID=1:length(idStudy),corr=corr,n=n)
df2 = df
```

Here is an example of a small meta-analysis dataset coding effect sizes (correlations) from `r length(levels(as.factor(idStudy)))` studies encompassing a total of `r length(levels(as.factor(idSample)))` samples. 

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
print(df, row.names=FALSE)
```

*Little but extremely common complication*: Some studies include more than one sample. Luckily, there is a single effect size for each sample (so `SampleID` and `EffID` are practically redundant here). If there were multiple effect sizes for the same sample, you might consider preliminarily aggregating them (unless to-be-aggregated effects are associated with different levels of a moderator of interest, in which case you should keep them separate and add an additional level in a multilevel model; note that this complicates everything a bit because you need to account for correlated sampling error when entering multiple effect sizes from a same group of subjects).

- Step 1: Converting all correlations to Fisher's z (good for normalizing the distribution, making the variances independent from the effect size, and simplifying subsequent computations):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(psych)
df$eff = fisherz(df$corr)
```

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
print(df, row.names=FALSE)
```

- Step 2: Compute the effect size variances using the analytical formula:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(psych)
df$vi = 1 / (df$n - 3)
```

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
print(df, row.names=FALSE)
```

Actually, you could directly use a built-in function named "`escalc`" from the "`metafor`" package itself:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(metafor)
escalc(measure="ZCOR", ri=corr, ni=n, data=df2)
```

#### Fitting the meta-analytic model

Now, let's proceed with a simple meta-analytic model... well, not so simple, since it's random-effects and multilevel!

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
fit = rma.mv(eff, vi, random =~ 1|StudyID/SampleID, data = df)
summary(fit)
```

Heterogeneity across effect sizes is quantified by the two "`sigma`". The first "`sigma`" represents the estimated heterogeneity across studies, often reported as $\tau$, the second "`sigma`" represents the estimated heterogeneity across samples/effect sizes (within studies), often reported as $\omega$.

#### Forest plot

Now let's have a look at the forest plot:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
forest(fit, 
       slab=paste0("Study",StudyID," - Sample",SampleID), 
       header=T,
       transf=psych::fisherz2r,
       xlab="Pearson's r")
```

#### Funnel plot

Routinely, funnel plot is reported for having a look at the distribution of effect sizes while simultaneously considering their variances. This may be the basis for applying methods for checking for publication bias, such as the "trim-and-fill" method... but note that trim-and-fill should NOT be used for multilevel models (as in this case) because it fails to account for the real (multilevel) structure of dependencies across effect sizes. 

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
funnel(fit,
       xlab="Fisher's z")
```

Here is a better version of the funnel plot with a meta-regression that takes into account the multilevel structure of the data:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# devtools::install_github("enricotoffalini/toffee")
library(ggplot2)
toffee::funnelT(fit, petpeese="petpeese")
```

#### Meta-regression, just for fun

Let's add publication year (numerical) as a possible moderator:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
fit1 = rma.mv(eff, vi, random =~ 1|StudyID/SampleID, mods =~ yearPub, data = df)
summary(fit1)
```

Comments? What would you say about:

- Have the heterogeneity estimates ("`sigma`") changed? (if moderators are useful, heterogeneity should be reduced)

- How do you establish the relevance of the moderators?

- How do you interpret the coefficients in "`Model Results`"?

Finally, here is the easiest way for plotting meta-regression:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
regplot(fit1)
```
